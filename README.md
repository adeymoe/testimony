## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Context API, Axios, JWT & Cooies for Auth, Multer, Node.js & Express etc

Infinite Scroll Feed — Browse testimonies in a continuous, immersive scroll experience like Twitter
Voice-to-Text Posting — Users can speak their testimonies and have them converted to text using a live mic input.
Emoji Reactions & Likes — Posts support rich emoji-based reactions with toggling and real-time counts.
Media Carousel — Users can attach images and audio to their testimony; media is displayed elegantly within a swipeable carousel.
User Profiles — Fully editable profiles with personalized testimony feeds and liked posts tab.
Dark Mode UI — Clean and modern dark interface built with user experience in mind.
Religious Diversity — Posts can be tagged by religion, promoting interfaith unity and exploration.

## Optimizations

These are some features in development that will take the pp to the next level:

Real-Time Notifications (using Socket.IO) for reactions, likes, and comments.
Comment Section — Users will soon be able to comment directly on posts.
Moderation & Reporting Tools — Content moderation with admin dashboard and post reporting.
Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline support and home screen installation.
